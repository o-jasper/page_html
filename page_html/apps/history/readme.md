History, userscript `althist.user.js` records it. Also has optional
"awful mirroring" utility.
(`althist.mirror.user.js` *just* mirrors and drops the rest)

#### TODO

* Removing entries.
* Mirroring just does `document.body.innerHTML`, and is fairly awful.
  + Needs to be possible view the mirrored files without loading assets.
